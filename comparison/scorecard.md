## Winner
**Design D · World-Class**

## Why It Won

- Most complete product-like interaction model (filters, compare drawer, modal funnel).
- Combines premium look with operational UX patterns for team decisions.

## Trade-offs
- Higher UI density than Design B, so onboarding copy must stay concise.
- More interaction complexity than Design A, so event QA is more important.

## Best Alternative If Goals Shift
- If top priority becomes strict mockup similarity, choose **Design A · Mockup**.
- If top priority becomes minimal visual/cognitive load, choose **Design B · Editorial**.
